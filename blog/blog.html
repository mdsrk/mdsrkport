  Web Server Attack Methodology and Tools
Similar to any attack, web server attacks also follow a methodology. Let’s look at the phases in the Web server attack methodology.

InformationGathering
Web Server Footprinting
WebsiteMirroring
VulnerabilityScanning
SessionHijacking
Web ServerPasswordHacking
Figure 1.1 Phases of the web server attack methodology, including the Information Gathering, Web Server Footprinting, Website Mirroring, Vulnerability Scanning, Session Hijacking and Web Server Password Hacking phases.

Information Gathering: An attacker narrows down on a specific target and attempts to gather as much information as possible. Various sources can be used to gather this information. For example, whois.com can be used to gain information about a specific domain. Some of the key tools in information gathering are:
Whois.domaintools.com – Whois Lookup
https://pentest-tools.com – Find subdomains
https://tools.dnsstuff.com – DNSstuff WHOIS
https://who.is - WHOIS Search, Domain Name, Website, and IP Tools
Web server Footprinting: An attacker attempts to gather information about a web server. This information can include the operating system and its version, sever name, etc. Several tools can be used in footprinting. Some of the key tools are:
Telnet
ID Serve
Netcraft
Httprecon
Netcat
Recon-ng
Uniscan
Nmap
Skipfish
Website Mirroring: An attacker makes a replica of the target website to study its structure. Some of the key tools used in this phase are:
NCollector Studio
HTTRack Website Copier
WebCopier Pro
Website Ripper Copier
Crytotek WebCopy
Website Ripper Copier
Website eXtractor
SurfOffline
Web-Site-Downloader
BackStreet Browser
SiteSucker
WebWhacker 5.0
Offline Explorer
WebAssistant Proxy Offline Browser
Vulnerability Scanning: An attacker performs vulnerability scanning on a web server. After vulnerabilities are found, they can exploit one or more vulnerabilities. Some of the key tools used in this phase are:
Acunetix Web Vulnerability Scanner
Tenable.io
Netsparker
Fortify WebInspect
Nikto
Session Hijacking: An attacker can also perform this step to hijack one of the client sessions. Some of the key tools used in this phase are:
Burp Suite
Ethercap
CookieCatcher
JHijack
Web server Password Hacking: An attacker performs a password cracking method to extract the web server’s password. Some of the key tools used in this phase are:
Hashcat
THC Hydra
Rainbow Crack
Wfuzz
Cain and Abel
Medusa
